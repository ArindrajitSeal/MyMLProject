Bond Price Prediction using ML Algorithms and comparison between the models

It was developed in the jupyter notebook as a .ipynb file. It is self-explanatory in nature. 

Part 1 is the direct application of LSTM,RNN and GRU. 
Part 2 is the modified approach where we converted the dataset to stationary and performed dimensional reduction using Random Forest Regressor approach.

Enjoy !!
